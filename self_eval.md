# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

*Figuring out the last method for the final practice. Going from creating an individual clause for each item down to a simplified version that was able to react to all the different inputs*

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

*Saving time is one of the biggest powers. Especially for a function that you are going to be using over and over within a program.*
*It essentially create a black box for us to use where the magic happens in the method and spits out what we're looking for each time we call it.*
